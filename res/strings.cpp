To cast a spell, first you need to get that energy from somewhere.  This is called a \"source\".\
\nNext, a spell needs to do something, called an \"action\".  Actions can get complicated, but most are as simple as making your\
\nallies faster or your enemies worse at casting spells.\
\nThe last part of a spell is the \"target\".  Tell the spell where to go and let fly!\
