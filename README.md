# StealthJrpg
Turn based stealth instead of combat

# Premise
You and your family have been rounded up and imprisoned (for some well developed politically charged reason to TBA).
Free your siblings/parents, escape the facility and eventually put a stop to whatever atrocities are taking place.

This is a stealth JRPG where the goal of turn-based battles is to sneak past or quietly disable enemies rather than attacking them head on with axes, gun-blades and fists.

# Win Conditions
- Reduce all Enemies Awareness (AWR) or Suspicion (SUS) to 0
- Occasionally, have all party members reach a certain tile.

# Lose Conditions
- All party member's Willpower (WIL) reduced to 0
- All members inflicted with CAUGHT status. 

# Progression
## Skill Trees
- Each party member has two main job branches, there may be much shorter branches here and there.
- Some smaller branches will be locked behind items, so sort of a combination of FF IX and X
  - For example, "Hack Cameras" may initially only be available when you have an item equipped.  But if you reach it in your skill tree and have the item available, you can then learn it permanently.


# Party Members
## Little Kid
Job Branches: Thief/Stealth, Hacker
- Highest Stealth
- Learns skills like Vanish
- Probably best at dealing with Cameras / Robots or whatever
- Out of combat, can crawl through vents 'n that.

## Teenager.
Job Branches: Healer, Ranged
- Highest Dexterity
- Gets skills affecting enemies at range such as Throw.

## Mother
Job Branches: Tank, Buffs 
- Let's give her best Speed and Highest Willpower.  Probably plays the role of tank??

## Father
Job Branches: Saboteur, Fighter
- Only party member able to really fight head-on
- Bit of a glass cannon
- Maybe he can also do some AOE effects that others can't (I'm thinking he has the strength to move heavy tables and stuff like that for barricades, or bust open doors or something)


# Stats
## PC Stats
### Willpower 
Essentially HP, but can be used to pay for skills as well. 

## Enemy Stats
### Suspicion
When at max, enemies will start to engage directly, dealing significant WIL damage and trying to inflict CAUGHT
When at 0, enemies will be idle.

### Awareness
When at 0, enemies are out of the encounter

### Direction
If looking at or near a PC, suspicion is more likely to be raised and skill effects more likely to hit that PC.

## Shared Stats

### Stealth
Need to develop idea further 
- Certain actions raise suspicion less if you have higher stealth
- And enemies less likely to target you

### Speed
Determines turn order

### Dexterity
